# AerospaceModels
 A mix of Aerospace models in 13th century Quake md2 and md3 format, with a few obj format. A couple have simple animation.
 These are set up to run in a cube engione game. 
 
 Most of these have been done by me and have a CC-By-SA licensing.
 The EA Destroyer and the Babylon 5 shuttle where not done by me and it's 20+ years since I found them so I forgotten the 
  artist or the licensing. Use at own risk.
